## Grad Admission Resources

Here are some resources that can help you navigate the application process and put your best foot forward. I've decided to compile this blog because I noticed that there are a lot of resources scattered across the internet, and it can be overwhelming to find the right information. I hope this list helps you in your journey to grad school! I will keep updating this list as I find more resources that helped me during my application process.
